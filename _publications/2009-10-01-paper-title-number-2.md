This work is about an utility patent for material transporter. We designed and developed a material transporter for microelectronic components with a suspended payload rack to drastically reduce vibrations and shaking while transporting the components; specifically, the rack was in a floating state relative to the frame using a buffer system. Drew diagrams of the transporter's structure in CAD and chose the suitable materials to build the model. Described the design in a detailed document and applied for a new utility patent.
