Education
======
* B.S., Microelectronics Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Science and Technology, 2018-2022
  * Weighted Average Score: 86.4/100(top 5% of the major)
* Summer camp, Integrated Circuit Design, Peking University, June. 2020- July. 2020 
* Visiting research student, Electronics and Engineering, Westlake University, June. 2021- May. 2022 
* PhD student, Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science & Technology, Sep. 2022- Now 

Research experience
======
* Sep. 2022 – Now: 
  * Emerging non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing, Advisers: Nazek Elatab              
    * Fabrication of 2D material based memristor
    * SNN-related algorithm and new applications for memory device
    * Device simulation via TCAD

* June. 2021 – April. 2022: 
  * Brain-machine interfaces and neuromorphic engineering, Advisers: Mohamad Sawan(Chair Professor, FIEEE, FCAE, FEIC)              
    * Biosignal analysis and processing (ECG, EMG, EEG)
    * Machine learning and hardware co-design (FPGA based)
    * Build a full loop biosignal analysis system

<!-- * Oct. 2020 – Dec. 2020:
  * Material Transporter for Microelectronic Products within a Workshop      Advisers: Weijun Chen
    * Designed and developed a material transporter for microelectronic components with a suspended payload rack to drastically reduce vibrations and shaking while transporting the components; specifically, the rack was in a floating state relative to the frame using a buffer system.
    * Drew diagrams of the transporter's structure in CAD and chose the suitable materials to build the model. Described the design in a detailed document and applied -->

<!-- * Dec. 2019 – Nov. 2019:
  * Wireless Atmospheric Laser Communication,       Advisers: Yining Mu
    * Contributed to the design and prototyping of an all-weather atmospheric telecommunication apparatus based on free-space optical (FSO) communication and state-of-the-art broadband access technology. 
    * Compared to current cabled fibreoptic technology, it is much cheaper and faster to set up, less cumbersome but has slightly slower broadband and shorter distance. 
    * Produced a business plan and presented it at an entrepreneurial competition. Qualified as a finalist for the "Internet+" competition, and the project was awarded "College Students' Innovative Entrepreneurial Training" funding.

* Dec. 2019 – Nov. 2019:
  * Gyroscope Teslameter,       Advisers: Weijun Chen
    * Researched and produced a model of a gyroscope Teslameter. It could measure magnetic field strength using a fast-rotating gyroscope made of conductive, non-ferromagnetic material which generated an asymmetric eddy current field; thus, Lorentz drag torque. 
    * Simulated the physical model, then built the experimental equipment, finally displayed the physical model at the intramural physics experiment competition and presented and explained the principles.
    * Obtained second prize in the Provincial physics experiment. -->

<!-- Work experience
======
* Dec. 2020 – Jan. 2021: Design Assistant, Suzhou INT Electronics Industry Co., Ltd 
  * Simulated and verified circuits using Multisim. Also assisted in the drawing of some basic layouts using CAD to meet the product requirements.
  * Gained a better understanding of the process of photomask manufacturing and improved proficiency in circuit design software.

* Jan. 2019 – Mar. 2019: Software Test assistant, Harbin Tongqu Network Technology Co., Ltd
  * Bulit an user interface with python qt to record the real-time online users of BanWai app and the user’s habit including the frequency and online time of different people.
  * Duties included: Merging pull requests
  * Built a training model of over 200 samples with SVM and gave some suggestions to specific group towards Banwai app. -->
